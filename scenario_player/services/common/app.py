class ServiceProcess(mp.Process):
    """:class:`multiprocessing.Process` subclass for running the SP services.

    The class's :meth:`.stop` method checks the server status and shuts it down
    via a POST request.

    Instances of this class have their :attr:`.daemon` attribute **always** set
    to `True`, regardless of any keywords passed to the class constructor.
    It can only be overridden by setting it after class initialization.

    Should the service not be reachable, it calls :meth:`.kill` instead, since
    the assumption is that it is stuck in a deadlock.

    Also offers a :func:`.app_is_responsive` property, which returns a boolean.
    This return `True` if a `GET /status` request returns a response (the status
    code does not matter) and `False` if a connection error or timeout occurred.

        is dead in the water and kill it.

        If we do get a response, but its status code is not in the `2xx` range,
